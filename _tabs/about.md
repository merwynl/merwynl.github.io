I am a Technical Artist with over 5 years of experience, specialising in look development, shaders, rendering optimization, pipeline optimization and more! With a foundation in photography and a passion for data-driven artistry, my goal is to captivate audiences with stunning visuals while maintaining seamless functionality across various platforms through rigorous problem solving and technical artistry.  

- 💡 Crafting immersive looks and moody aesthetics is my favourite thing 
- 🛠️ I also love tinkering about with different development tools and processes that can streamline art workflows and automate repetitive tasks
- 📸 When I'm not tickering about, I'm either taking photos or knee deep in some book
